The leader of [[The Town of Bree|Bree]], Baron Elmdore, is a humble man, preferring to work alongside his people in the fields than sit idle in a manor. His simple attire of well-worn clothes, often speckled with dust and soil, doesn't scream of his status. However, his people respect and love him for his dedication and hard work.

Elmdore was happily married, but tragically, his wife, Lady Marianne, passed away last year due to old age. Their love was the talk of the town, and her death has left a gaping hole in the Baron's life. They were unable to have children, leaving Elmdore without an heir.

As such, upon Elmdore's death, control of Bree would pass to the regional Viscount, who would likely appoint a new steward. This worries Elmdore as he fears a less caring steward could destroy what he and Marianne worked so hard to build. As such, he is dedicated to ensuring Bree's survival through the drought.

Elmdore is a capable leader, but he's not an adventurer. Elmdore keeps a token of his wife with him - a small locket with her portrait. He often consults it in tough times for guidance and solace.

## Hopes:

1.  To ensure the survival and prosperity of Bree, especially during and after the drought.
2.  To honor his late wife's memory by maintaining the peaceful and caring community they built together.
3.  To find a capable and kind-hearted steward who can lead Bree in his absence and keep the town's spirit alive.

## Worries:

1.  That he won't be able to save Bree from the drought and the town will either be abandoned or its people will starve.
2.  That the Viscount will appoint an uncaring or exploitative steward to manage Bree after he's gone.
3.  That he's growing old and may not have much time left to ensure the wellbeing of his town and people.

## Ideals:

1.  **Community**: He believes in working alongside his people, leading by example rather than authority.
2.  **Kindness**: He is deeply committed to creating a caring, supportive environment in Bree where everyone looks out for each other.
3.  **Dedication**: He is extremely dedicated to his town and its people, often placing their needs before his own. He sees Bree not just as a responsibility, but as his life's work.
