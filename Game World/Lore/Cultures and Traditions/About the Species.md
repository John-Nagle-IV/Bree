# Orcs
Orcs are highly curious and explorative. They are nomadic until they find something cool and then build a settlement nearby. The village is usually named after the founding family and uses Og' to note "by water", Rog' to note "by rock/mountain", Mog' to note "by tree/forest", and Gog' to note "by grassland"

# Dwarfs
Dwarfs have a similar naming convention using the prefix "Dun" to mean "under". As a whole, the group tends to be very proud of their artists and craftsmanship often showing off the strength of their metalwork, details of their tailors, and taste of their food.

# Elves
Villages and towns are grown, not constructed. They use a "[[Items#Village Seed|Village Seed]]" to grow a tree whose magics influence the land around them to create dwellings. This process can take about 100 years, but the long lives of elves make this no problem, and they often go out exploring while their home is growing.

Elven traditions run long and one such is their devotion to crafts. Boasting the lightest of wares while maintaining strength and durability that seemingly come from nowhere, elves are proud in their works and challenge others to do better.

# Dragons
Dragons tend to have hyper-fixations and that's what becomes their hoard. There are Dragons who hoard gold, like the classic tales, but there are also dragons who hoard books, instruments, smoked meats, rocks that look like people's heads, actually people's heads... Anything can become the dragon's fixation really, and once it's locked it they are pretty compulsive to collect it.

To that end, Dragonborn or those with dragon lineage tend to also have this compulsion, though it's much less than an actual dragon.
