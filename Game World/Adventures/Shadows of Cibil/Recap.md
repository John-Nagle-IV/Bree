# Session 1 - Forfsday, 10th of Highgro, 1024 N.E.:

# Session 2 - Fifday, 11th of Highgro, 1024 N.E.:

A haphazard job posting in the market square has set everyone off. The job, outside [[The Merchants' Guild]] purview, has the group venturing to find a wizard's college in the city to help an ailing gnome. Stealing coinage and tickets from a couple of wealthy merchants, the subway system of the city is made available as the party travels north, away from the docks. With the "[[Game World/Lore/Calendar/Holidays and Festivals/Flag's Afloat]]" Festival only a day and a half away, will they save this sick gnome in time?

# Session 3 - Sixday - Morning, 12th of Highgro, 1024 N.E.:

A successful trip was made to the Wizard's College of "[[Viaz University]]" where it was discovered that the Gnome going by the name "Nightheart" was actually the headmaster by the name of [[Lady Fennove Tempercable]]! Her poisoning of [[Night Blossom]] was a self-medicated attempt to slow the process of [Ceremorphosis](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ceremorphosis) (the process of turning into a [Mind Flayer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17104-mind-flayer) via the parasitic tadpole infection).  
  
Finding [[Professor Harrison Stonebottom]] giving a lecture on the open grassy commons, the party was quickly whisked away to his office by a conjured [Arcane Gate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/arcane-gate) once he saw the headmaster slung over [[Liam]]'s shoulder like a sack of flour. [[Professor Harrison Stonebottom]] fetched a small cohort of esteemed colleagues, before thanking the group and having  [[Lady Fennove Tempercable]] whisked away to have the tadpole removed and to have her recover. In a brief dialogue, the group learned that she was only a few months in her sabbatical doing research in the [[Tunnels]] on the monstrous worms known for creating the elaborate pathways from which "The [[Tunnels]]" draw its namesake. As a thank you for saving their headmaster, [[Professor Harrison Stonebottom]] inscribed a runic pass into each of their left hands granting them permission to use the Teleportation Circles found linking the Wizard Colleges in "[[Sungate]]", "[[Port Viaz-Ros]]", and "[[Beacon]]" (with a few rules on how to use them). As an added bonus he provided the group each with a return ticket back to the [[Port Viaz-Ros#Docks|Docks]] by the city's train.  

Basking in their success, the group's relaxation efforts were cut short as a group of bandits caused the train to come to a halt. Ransacking the cargo, the bandits almost escaped with a prized package, but were slain by the group. From the [bandit captain's](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16799-bandit-captain) grasp, the tightly swaddled item which he coveted was exposed as he fell, revealing an old, golden oil lamp

# Session 4 - Sixday - Afternoon, 12th of Highgro, 1024 N.E.:

Our group, injured and exhausted from their bout with the bandits had a brief moment of rest. While tying the unconscious [Bandit Capitan](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16799-bandit-captain) and securing the small lamp that he was attempting to smuggle, a pair of fellow adventurers seeking the completion of an escort found them. Their charge, an exhausting noble woman ranting at guards who had approached to control the situation and take statements, was enough to drive them to seek a moment of peace by making introductions.  
  
Taking interest in the group as well, detective [[Alfred Perrybottom]] took their statements, the lamp as evidence, the bound bandit, and gave them a voucher for a 50gp bounty to be redeemed at a guardhouse and a small card which can be used to contact him.  
  
The group, leaving the train which is still stuck as the city's [[Guild of Engineers]] started to make repairs, started looking for a way back to the docks and a guardhouse to redeem the voucher. Luck would have it that a guardhouse was pretty easy to find, but the bureaucracy of government consumed a good hour or so of time as they got their gold.  
  
Leaving the guardhouse, one of the adventurers from before, a [Tabaxi with some oddly flowing fur](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/81403896), had seemingly opted to ditch his friend with the noisy noble, and joined the main body of the group. All together, they doubled their efforts to find a carriage back to the docks. Sadly, the only horse they could find appeared sickly and old, but have no fear, as the city provides opportunity around every corner. Overhearing their plight, [[Mr. Sparktwine]], an entrepreneurial gnome with a knack for gears offered them the chance to use his experimental mechanical horse.

Rather than risking the possibility of having this mechanical beast explode on them, 16th times the charm according to [[Mr. Sparktwine]], the group opted to drink him under the table, win 20gp off a bet and continue walking to the docks.  
  
While walking they all found the other adventurer, the [elven wizard](), passed out on the street, being left there as the noble only purchased a horse for herself and expecting the wizard to keep up on foot. Waking him up, he was bereft to find his coin purse stolen, but relief came soon after as his spellbook was still with him. The group, now two members larger, continues their march towards the docks as tomorrow is [[Game World/Lore/Calendar/Holidays and Festivals/Flag's Afloat]]!

# Session 5 - Sixday - Evening, 12th of Highgro, 1024 N.E.:

Having decided wandering on foot to be the safer choice, our group stumbled upon an odd sight as their walk back to the docks continued: a [Fire Genasi](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/108552457) goading and laughing hysterically atop a table outside a bar, fists bloodied. Surrounding her, several men on the ground, blood pouring from their mouth, teeth missing, also laughing in a dazed mania. A gentile green fog covering these men, emanating from an oversized tankard in the hands of an elderly woman.

As she slammed the tankard, another plumb of green smoke bellowed out, and a cackle as equally boisterous; cheering the blood and violence. [Liam](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/102938356), hearing the call to a "friendly bar room brawl", could not help himself, as he and [Char](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/108552457) exchanged blows. Blood was spilled to the great joy of this elderly lady, though it didn't seem enough.

The fumes held a herbal and cloyingly sweet scent as they wafted about, though the group didn't seem to be terribly effected by them.

While this bout was exchanged, our odd and curious Tabaxi, [Meed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/81403896), cozied up next to the woman, and after a bit of bartering, made a simple coin exchange for some of the odd brew from her tankard. In addition to the coin, a bit of acid was tossed into the battling duo to the great enjoyment of the lady.

Asking for greater and greater displays between the sparing two; going so far to demand gouging eyes and bathing the bodies in more acid, the party became more suspicious of her. Not yielding to her demands, her body contorted into a grotesque [Green Hag](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16911-green-hag). With a curse at the party for not going along with her fun, she slammed the tankard down one final time. The smoke entering the bodies of the three downed men raising them as [Zombies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17077-zombie).

While the party fought the undead, the hag made her escape in a puff of noxious green smoke.

After the undead became just dead, a brief look into the eerily quiet bar which they were all fighting outside brought with it a horrific scene. Mutilated bodies strewn everywhere in a grotesque display. [Nalessia](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/102823104) doing what she does best, had rummaged around looking for valuables. Some extra coin was added to her purse as well as an envelop containing the seal of [[The Undertow]]. 

Thoroughly exhausted, the group finally makes it back to [[The Shanty by the Sea]], ready for a good nights sleep; well, most of them. Tomorrow morning brings with it [[Game World/Lore/Calendar/Holidays and Festivals/Flag's Afloat]] and the challenges of the festival, though with how eventful these past couple of days have been, the "challenges" may end up feeling like a reprieve!

# Session 6 - Onesday - Morning, 13th of Highgro, 1024 N.E.:

An early morning rise with a bout of chaos. The sounds of the festivities from the docks was like a noisy alarm, and the morning sun left no person unstirred. [Char](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/108552457), the night before, had a bit of difficulty propping the bed against her door and opted to pile the disassembled pieces and the hay filled matrass in leu. Her morning was spent attempting to undo what was done, but either by misjudging her own strength or the weave of cloth, in a mighty heave the matrass was torn in twain and straw bellowed out the window onto the street below. [Nalessia](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/102823104), [Liam](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/102938356), and [Bat's](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/103881938), stirred by the commotion have their heads out the window greeting the day and [Char](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/108552457) covered in straw.

Down below in the street, [Meed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/81403896) sits perched on a lamp post watching the dockhands scurry about like mice. A callout to him from the group above has him slink off the post and find his way back towards the inn. Barreling downstairs,  [Char](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/108552457) ends up in front of the keeper of this inn, **Isabella**, explaining

# Session 7 - Onesday - Afternoon, 13th of Highgro 1024 N.E.:

The afternoon was a buzz of activity as the party attempted to get some last minute goods. Struggling to find potions. With a bit of luck, but in the opposite direction, the party found their way into [[Endwize the Alchemist]]'s shop. While rambling on about his newest concoction, a [[Potion of True Resurrection]], which he was happy to grant a dose with a few caveats of what may happen.

While fishing for deals, [Meed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/81403896) had taken the opportunity to scare [[Endwize the Alchemist]] into lowering his prices. Equal parts fear and fascination filled [[Endwize the Alchemist]] and he watched the Tabaxi's face melt and distort. The group got their discounts and made away with a couple of healing potions and one of [[Endwize the Alchemist]]'s special brews. 

After potions galore and a some minor meddling, the party made their way to [[Tilda Bronzebrow Viaz]] to get a bit of a pep-talk and a promise of reward. As the party discussed happenings, the nature of [[Endwize the Alchemist]]'s experimentations came up. The party found that his work has the full backing of the nobility as a means to help combat the undead that have ravaged half the land. A little poking into the balance between life and death gave hint that [[Tilda Bronzebrow Viaz]] may have lost someone close to her, though pressing her for more direct information only seemed to spark a rage in her.

Choosing to spare themselves her wrath, the party ventured back to the docks. With [[Tilda Bronzebrow Viaz]]'s blessing, or more accurately threat against failure

# Session 8 - Onesday - Evening, 13th of Highgro 1024 N.E.:

The first battle of [[Flag's Afloat]]. A race to the orb was swift as both sides hopped along floating rafts and barrels. The Gnome Druid, [[Dixle Gobstop]] rode his majestic wolf [[Felix]] to get up and close to the champions of [[House Viaz]], attempting to blast them away with magic and knock them off into the shark infested waters below. After a few blows exchanged, the champions of [[House Viaz]] were victorious in capturing the ball

# Session 9

Victory prizes galore as the team was presented with a voucher for one of the "High End" armor shops: [[Ingval's Forge and Fettle]]. One item less than 3,000 GP, or 3,000 GP off any one item. After some discussion, [[Bat's Wing (Bats)]] was granted the [Elven Leafweave Armor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/7659951-elven-leafweave-armor). 

- the night is very very quiet, nothing is heard aside from the one off cat wandering around. BATZ and MEAD are found in an alley with a dead body. fun stuff.
- BATZ parts to go find a guard station to report the body. the docks are a place where crime is generally commited so there is some form of guard presence around. Its going to take BATZ about 10 minutes to run across some guards.
- a pair of guards is found, half chatting walking up and down the docks, the sound of BATZ quickly coming up to them startles them. BATZ guides the 2 guards to the bodies, one guard takes a sending stone out of their pocket and talk into it, reporting back to HQ.
-  MEAD collects a sample of the bodies blood to add to their collection and hides close.
-  LIAM is back at the inn, getting the panicked person to calm down enough to chat with him about things. the person is slumped back into the clerks desk still breathing heavy, eyes darting around. LIAM assured them that everything was going to be ok. knocking on the inn keepers door to say things have calmed down out there.
- the inn keeper opens the door cautiously, recognizing LIAM, then bursts through. LIAM informed her that the other people in the party were getting the guards for them. the keeper is sobbing and the other guest is still having a panic attack, LIAM is winning at this calming down bit.
- BATZ barely sees MEAD hiding in the shadows as they walk up to the body. explaining to the guards that THIS body is the one of the person who commited the attack at the inn, they would not come quietly and this was the result of that chase.
- the guards speak into the sending stone that they were on the way to the SHANTY BY THE SEA, but the party never hears any replies coming back. a one way communication line.
- lanturn guard heads to the SHANTY BY THE SEA, the 2nd guard decides to secure the current crime scene. he pulls out a small torch and begins working the crime scene as the lantern guard brings both BATZ and MEAD towards SHANTY BY THE SEA. takes another few minutes to get to the destination. as they approach they hear the inn keeper sobbing. the guard pounds on the door. LIAM hears it and shuffles towards the door with the inn keeper to let the guards in. the half elf that was left on the ground at the mention of guards shuffles back behind the podium and says "NO ITS THEM. ITS THEM."
- the half elf scrambles towards the window ready to Scott Pilgrim out of there, LIAM makes an attempt to reach and grab him and was successful. the guard asks what was going on here, LIAM pointed to the room and guided the guard towards the body and says that the half elf being detained said this guy was his friend.
- 10-15 minutes later, several other guards arrive, in that time the lanturn guard had been moving through the room checking for other dangers, clues, making notes, etc. scratching down anything on a pad of paper in his hands. interviews the inn keeper, and puts the elf in cuffs to make sure he doesnt try to escape again, handcuffed to the banister. "i need to keep you here. thank you, all of you for your work for the city, we will ask that you remain here as we get everyones stories straight. more of my collegues will be here in a few minutes. you cannot leave the city for the next couple of days. your descriptions have been relayed to the guards, please go back to your rooms for the time being." he begins the question the inn keeper first.
- LIAM goes back to his room, BATZ stays around, MEAD goes back to the roof.
- 
- ----took a small break myself----
- 
- the party has learned that the two persons being escorted out have a connection with the cauldron.
- things have settled down, BATZ asked if he could help with anything else. guards asked him the basic interview questions about the situation and he answered honestly for all of them. "and what about your interactions with the now dead murderer?" never seen him before, never met him. heard noise outside and BATZ followed the noise. outside of tonight though they have never met. the guards will be in contact with the rest of the group over the next couple of days.
- guard flips through his notes looking at BATZ, "do you happen to remember a person named DYLYSSA." met when they first came to the city, not sure what happened to her, they woke up one morning and they were gone. "just to give a heads up, she is implicated on the theft of train tickets from high nobles and pocket change, but we might have to have you answer some questions on that as well."
- the inn keeper is now calmed down quite a bit from earlier, shes looking over the damages, half exhausted from the goings on. says sorry for everything and would understand if they wanted to find another inn to stay at.
- 
- --------------------------------...EEPIES TIME...-------------------------------
- 
- the mornings comes, the few ships that could get in before the games begin find their way in. the docks and city spring up and come to life, the sounds drifting into the inn greeting the party. MEAD and LIAM sleepy sleepy. MARK is up and ready in the morning.
- there is increased guard activity as MARK goes down from their room in the morning. BATZ explained what happened to MARK. no complimentary breakfast. darn the luck.
-  a guard is arguing with the inn keeper about cleaning up a crime scene. BATZ and LUCIAN make their way outside. flags-a-float fest starts around 3pm, must meet lady viaz at her manor at that time.
- LUCIAN and BATZ start looking for ways to make a quick buck. busking, helping the dock hands get through ships, talk to Boom Boom (has connections to more iffy parts of the city). they both find their way to Boom Booms tavern and just walk through the hole in the wall. its usually very lively and energetic, although this morning everyone is asleep and drunk in their cups. a very quiet morning. BATZ makes their way through the room to the bar where Boom Boom is, feet up smoking a cigar, reading the morning paper. 
- BATZ asks Boom Boom if there was anything they could do to help him out this morning. Boom Boom hands them a letter, in this note they find a shipping manifest. normal things on the manifest then a symbol for the undertow next to x2 BARRELS OF BOOM BOOM SYRUP. they are to take it down to the docks and show it to a man named GRIMES on the FALL OF SUNSHINE boat to get Boom Booms goodies for him.
- BATZ and LUCIAN find their way back to the docks, where it has started to become more chaotic than normal. dock hands are working hard moving around like crazy. BATZ is having issues finding the boat, but LUCIAN is able to navigate through the sea of bodies going towards the FALL OF SUNSHINE.
- all walks of life, all kinds of deck hands are helping out on the boat getting things off of the boat.
- they run into VIKTOR who goes to get grimes for them. grimes kicks opens the door and makes his way out to the party. hes a very tall human, rough stubble beard, tanned skin, wearing only linen pants and very much barefoot. he looks behind VIKTOR and sees BATZ and LUCIAN. he goes back in and then out, and they see tucked into his waistband a pistol, grimes takes the paper from them and gives it a once over.  instructs VIKTOR to help these people and he goes to the foreman to help the party out.
- VIKTOR recognizes the symbol for the UNDERTOW, knowing they move all sorts of goods across the waterways to various individuals. for VIKTOR they were very helpful in the past. VIKTOR sees Grimes hand over a sack of coins to the dock foreman as he witnesses the transaction being done.
- VIKTOR is moving the barrels one at a time and skillfully gets one up to where the gangplank is, going back to get the other one and bring it up to the front as well.
- BATZ and LUCIAN watch VIKTOR bring out the barrels and head back into the hull of the ship. trying to figure out how they will be getting this boom boom juice to Boom Booms tavern.
- VIKTOR comes back up to see both BATZ and LUCIAN arguing about the barrel, BATZ turns and thanks VIKTOR, who offers to help carry back to the tavern but BATZ explains they need to be transported VERY VERY carefully. VIKTOR does not see any carts empty, but sees one that only has a few things loaded into it. 
- BATZ walks up to the cart that would see if there is anything that seems safe to set out and take the cart. no one seems to be looking after this cart from what he can see. This cart is in use but whoever is using it is nowhere near, BATZ sets everything outside the cart and wheels the cart over to the boom boom juice, but finds out the first crate in the cart is VERY HEAVY and needs help moving it. 
- BATZ and LUCIAN move the first crate out of the wagon. Crate numbah 2: they start sliding the 2nd crate, it gets to the edge of the wagon but one slips and the crate crashes to the ground. the top is split open for all to see. this has caused some attention to go their way but not too much. LUCIAN attempts to sneaky sneak one of the shiny items in the crate, BATZ for sure sees the attempt and stops LUCIAN in his tracks.
- they are about 3 steps down the gangplank when someones footing slips. time seems to slow down, VIKTOR drops one and it falls off the gangplank and slams into the water below, banging into the side of the ship. VIKTOR feels the blast for sure, but is able to scurry down the gangplank and get the other barrel to a safe distance. the ship is on fire. cargo is on fire. EVERYTHING IS ON FIRE. the ship is sinking. everyone is rushing to figure out what the hell happened. GRIMES is one of them, storming up to VIKTOR super pissed. 
- 
- --------------------------------...COMBAT BEGINS...-------------------------------
-  
- I dont take many notes during combat~~ lots of explosions. like A LOT. like damn. There was an attempt at rescuing VIKTOR from death but the potion backfired. RIP VIKTOR. may your dust make your enemies sneeze for all eternity.
