# Session 1 - Forfsday, 10th of Highgro, 1024 N.E.:

# Session 2 - Fifday, 11th of Highgro, 1024 N.E.:

A haphazard job posting in the market square has set everyone off. The job, outside [[The Merchants' Guild]] purview, has the group venturing to find a wizard's college in the city to help an ailing gnome. Stealing coinage and tickets from a couple of wealthy merchants, the subway system of the city is made available as the party travels north, away from the docks. With the "[[Flag's Afloat]]" Festival only a day and a half away, will they save this sick gnome in time?

# Session 3 - Sixday - Morning, 12th of Highgro, 1024 N.E.:

A successful trip was made to the Wizard's College of "[[Viaz University]]" where it was discovered that the Gnome going by the name "Nightheart" was actually the headmaster by the name of [[Lady Fennove Tempercable]]! Her poisoning of [[Night Blossom]] was a self-medicated attempt to slow the process of [Ceremorphosis](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ceremorphosis) (the process of turning into a [Mind Flayer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17104-mind-flayer) via the parasitic tadpole infection).  
  
Finding [[Professor Harrison Stonebottom]] giving a lecture on the open grassy commons, the party was quickly whisked away to his office by a conjured [Arcane Gate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/arcane-gate) once he saw the headmaster slung over [[Liam]]'s shoulder like a sack of flour. [[Professor Harrison Stonebottom]] fetched a small cohort of esteemed colleagues, before thanking the group and having  [[Lady Fennove Tempercable]] whisked away to have the tadpole removed and to have her recover. In a brief dialogue, the group learned that she was only a few months in her sabbatical doing research in the [[Tunnels]] on the monstrous worms known for creating the elaborate pathways from which "The [[Tunnels]]" draw its namesake. As a thank you for saving their headmaster, [[Professor Harrison Stonebottom]] inscribed a runic pass into each of their left hands granting them permission to use the Teleportation Circles found linking the Wizard Colleges in "[[Sungate]]", "[[Port Viaz-Ros]]", and "[[Beacon]]" (with a few rules on how to use them). As an added bonus he provided the group each with a return ticket back to the [[Port Viaz-Ros#Docks|Docks]] by the city's train.  

Basking in their success, the group's relaxation efforts were cut short as a group of bandits caused the train to come to a halt. Ransacking the cargo, the bandits almost escaped with a prized package, but were slain by the group. From the [bandit captain's](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16799-bandit-captain) grasp, the tightly swaddled item which he coveted was exposed as he fell, revealing an old, golden oil lamp

# Session 4 - Sixday - Afternoon, 12th of Highgro, 1024 N.E.:

Our group, injured and exhausted from their bout with the bandits had a brief moment of rest. While tying the unconscious [Bandit Capitan](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16799-bandit-captain) and securing the small lamp that he was attempting to smuggle, a pair of fellow adventurers seeking the completion of an escort found them. Their charge, an exhausting noble woman ranting at guards who had approached to control the situation and take statements, was enough to drive them to seek a moment of peace by making introductions.  
  
Taking interest in the group as well, detective [[Alfred Perrybottom]] took their statements, the lamp as evidence, the bound bandit, and gave them a voucher for a 50gp bounty to be redeemed at a guardhouse and a small card which can be used to contact him.  
  
The group, leaving the train which is still stuck as the city's [[Guild of Engineers]] started to make repairs, started looking for a way back to the docks and a guardhouse to redeem the voucher. Luck would have it that a guardhouse was pretty easy to find, but the bureaucracy of government consumed a good hour or so of time as they got their gold.  
  
Leaving the guardhouse, one of the adventurers from before, a [Tabaxi with some oddly flowing fur](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/81403896), had seemingly opted to ditch his friend with the noisy noble, and joined the main body of the group. All together, they doubled their efforts to find a carriage back to the docks. Sadly, the only horse they could find appeared sickly and old, but have no fear, as the city provides opportunity around every corner. Overhearing their plight, [[Mr. Sparktwine]], an entrepreneurial gnome with a knack for gears offered them the chance to use his experimental mechanical horse.

Rather than risking the possibility of having this mechanical beast explode on them, 16th times the charm according to [[Mr. Sparktwine]], the group opted to drink him under the table, win 20gp off a bet and continue walking to the docks.  
  
While walking they all found the other adventurer, the [elven wizard](), passed out on the street, being left there as the noble only purchased a horse for herself and expecting the wizard to keep up on foot. Waking him up, he was bereft to find his coin purse stolen, but relief came soon after as his spellbook was still with him. The group, now two members larger, continues their march towards the docks as tomorrow is [[Flag's Afloat]]!

# Session 5 - Sixday - Evening, 12th of Highgro, 1024 N.E.:

Having decided wandering on foot to be the safer choice, our group stumbled upon an odd sight as their walk back to the docks continued: a [Fire Genasi](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/108552457) goading and laughing hysterically atop a table outside a bar, fists bloodied. Surrounding her, several men on the ground, blood pouring from their mouth, teeth missing, also laughing in a dazed mania. A gentile green fog covering these men, emanating from an oversized tankard in the hands of an elderly woman.

As she slammed the tankard, another plumb of green smoke bellowed out, and a cackle as equally boisterous; cheering the blood and violence. [Liam](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/102938356), hearing the call to a "friendly bar room brawl", could not help himself, as he and [Char](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/108552457) exchanged blows. Blood was spilled to the great joy of this elderly lady, though it didn't seem enough.

The fumes held a herbal and cloyingly sweet scent as they wafted about, though the group didn't seem to be terribly effected by them.

While this bout was exchanged, our odd and curious Tabaxi, [Meed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/81403896), cozied up next to the woman, and after a bit of bartering, made a simple coin exchange for some of the odd brew from her tankard. In addition to the coin, a bit of acid was tossed into the battling duo to the great enjoyment of the lady.

Asking for greater and greater displays between the sparing two; going so far to demand gouging eyes and bathing the bodies in more acid, the party became more suspicious of her. Not yielding to her demands, her body contorted into a grotesque [Green Hag](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16911-green-hag). With a curse at the party for not going along with her fun, she slammed the tankard down one final time. The smoke entering the bodies of the three downed men raising them as [Zombies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17077-zombie).

While the party fought the undead, the hag made her escape in a puff of noxious green smoke.

After the undead became just dead, a brief look into the eerily quiet bar which they were all fighting outside brought with it a horrific scene. Mutilated bodies strewn everywhere in a grotesque display. [Nalessia](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/102823104) doing what she does best, had rummaged around looking for valuables. Some extra coin was added to her purse as well as an envelop containing the seal of [[The Undertow]]. 

Thoroughly exhausted, the group finally makes it back to [[The Shanty by the Sea]], ready for a good nights sleep; well, most of them. Tomorrow morning brings with it [[Flag's Afloat]] and the challenges of the festival, though with how eventful these past couple of days have been, the "challenges" may end up feeling like a reprieve!

# Session 6 - Onesday - Morning, 13th of Highgro, 1024 N.E.:

An early morning rise with a bout of chaos. The sounds of the festivities from the docks was like a noisy alarm, and the morning sun left no person unstirred. [Char](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/108552457), the night before, had a bit of difficulty propping the bed against her door and opted to pile the disassembled pieces and the hay filled matrass in leu. Her morning was spent attempting to undo what was done, but either by misjudging her own strength or the weave of cloth, in a mighty heave the matrass was torn in twain and straw bellowed out the window onto the street below. [Nalessia](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/102823104), [Liam](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/102938356), and [Bat's](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/103881938), stirred by the commotion have their heads out the window greeting the day and [Char](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/108552457) covered in straw.

Down below in the street, [Meed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/81403896) sits perched on a lamp post watching the dockhands scurry about like mice. A callout to him from the group above has him slink off the post and find his way back towards the inn. Barreling downstairs,  [Char](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/108552457) ends up in front of the keeper of this inn, **Isabella**, explaining
