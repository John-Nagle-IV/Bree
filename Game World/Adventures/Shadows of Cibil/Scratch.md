Zero infected with
**Blue Mist Fever**
An infected creature begins seeing vivid hallucinations of blue monkeys 5 hours after failing the save, and the hallucinations last until the disease ends on the creature. A creature can repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Mindfire**
The creature's mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the [confusion](https://5e.tools/spells.html#confusion_phb) spell during combat.

Liam infected with
**Bluerot**
This disease targets humanoids. While afflicted with bluerot, a victim grows grotesque blue boils on their face and back. This disease is carried by undead (including the drowned ones in Tammeraut's Fate), and victims most often acquire it through wounds caused by infected creatures. The disease's boils manifest in 1d4 hours, causing the victim's Constitution and Charisma scores to decrease by 1d4 each, to a minimum of 3. This is quickly followed by a fever and tingling in the extremities. An infected creature is vulnerable to radiant damage and gains the ability to breathe underwater.

### 🕯️ **Interrogation Recap – The Bound Hag in Lady Viaz’s Dungeon**

In the flickering gloom of Lady Viaz’s stone-walled dungeon, the party interrogated the captured Night Hag—first with words, then with power, threats, and the soul bag that once housed Lord Ros.

Over the course of the interrogation:

---

### 🎯 What the Party Learned:

#### 🧩 **Coven Details**

- The **coven’s lair** is located in a **massive cavern** at the center of the city’s sewers.
- The **Kraken’s body** lies there, sleeping—**severed from its mind**.
- The Night Hags plan to **break the seal** and **rebind the Kraken’s mind to their control**.


#### ⚔️ **Hag Sisters' Powers**

- **Morga** uses **toxic fumes and necrotic plagues** to raise the dead. Her weakness is air—**remove her breath**, and her control collapses.
- **Virelda** manipulates others through **dolls, marionettes, and enchanted strings**. Severing her control requires breaking her **puppet hearts**—arcane foci linked to each victim.

#### 🧠 **Psychological Insight**

- The captured Hag holds **deep envy and spite** toward her sisters—especially Virelda.
- When pressed, she admitted she'd **betray the coven** if freed, promising to **dissolve the coven bond** empowering the others.
- She seemed _gleeful_ at the idea of their downfall.

---

### 💀 **Revealed Truths**

- **Lord Alabaster Ros is dead**—his body devoured by a Black Pudding in the sewers.  
    His **flesh was used to create the Hag’s soul bag**, and his **soul was part of the ritual** to sunder the Kraken’s mind from its body.
- A **Seeming-disguised zombie guard**, intended to warn the Hags of the party’s knowledge, was intercepted and destroyed by Bats and Zero inside Lady Viaz’s manor.

---

### ⚗️ **Key Artifact – The Toxic Tankard**

- Liam revealed **The Toxic Tankard**, a **critical necrotic focus** stolen from Morga.
- The Hag laughed, mocking Morga’s loss—revealing she hasn’t seen her sister in several days and hinting that **Morga may have already been undone** by the Tankard’s loss.

---

### 🧩 **Next Steps Given by the Hag**

- The Hag confirmed she still holds her **ritual anchor**, one of the three needed for the Kraken-binding.
- She offered to **help dissolve the coven’s power** if the party frees her.

----

Zero updates the Hag's traps
1. Illusory Wall 
2. Trapped Narrow Path
	T1 - Acid Trap -> Explosive Trap & Harder Disarm
	T2 - Needle Trap -> Harder Disarm
	T3 - Smash Trap -> Collapse Trap & Harder Disarm

Overheard the Hags bickering - they discovered something in the dreams of [[Groseman Glasseye]].
Char overheard them with comprehend languages and the rumbling voice of the kraken
