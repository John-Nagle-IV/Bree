Zero infected with
**Blue Mist Fever**
An infected creature begins seeing vivid hallucinations of blue monkeys 5 hours after failing the save, and the hallucinations last until the disease ends on the creature. A creature can repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Mindfire**
The creature's mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the [confusion](https://5e.tools/spells.html#confusion_phb) spell during combat.

Liam infected with
**Bluerot**
This disease targets humanoids. While afflicted with bluerot, a victim grows grotesque blue boils on their face and back. This disease is carried by undead (including the drowned ones in Tammeraut's Fate), and victims most often acquire it through wounds caused by infected creatures. The disease's boils manifest in 1d4 hours, causing the victim's Constitution and Charisma scores to decrease by 1d4 each, to a minimum of 3. This is quickly followed by a fever and tingling in the extremities. An infected creature is vulnerable to radiant damage and gains the ability to breathe underwater.
