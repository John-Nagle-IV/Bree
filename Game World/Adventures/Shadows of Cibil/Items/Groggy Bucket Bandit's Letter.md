**Thieves' Cant Translation:**

*"Been thinking of catching up with some old mates at the Groggy Bucket, maybe watch the games. Heard they're bringing over a special brew for the occasion. Odd thing, they're all fussy about handling it, always with gloves, like it's some sort of collector's item. Ran into Sigmond by the docks, he's planning a fishing trip, leaving at dawn on the day the games start. Told me it's a popular time, spots fill up fast, so no dilly-dallying if you're interested."*
