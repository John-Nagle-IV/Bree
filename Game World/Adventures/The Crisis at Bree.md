Despite [[The Town of Bree|Bree]]'s modest size, it contributes significantly to the local grain production, crucial to the larger towns and cities nearby. But with the drought, the fields have turned brown and the river running through Bree has all but dried up. The last harvest was meager, and the granaries are nearly empty.

The capital, overwhelmed by similar requests, has sent court Druids only to the largest towns, leaving Bree and other small communities to fend for themselves. Desperation is starting to creep into Bree, the threat of hunger is real and getting closer every day.

# The Drunken and Dangerous
**Location:** [[The Town of Bree#The Plowed Farmer Inn|The Plowed Farmer Inn]] 

## Introduction
The evening breeze tugs at your cloaks as you approach the "Plowed Farmer Inn". The light spilling from its windows casts a welcoming glow in the dusky twilight. As you push open the creaky wooden door, the homely aroma of baked bread and the fruity notes of freshly tapped ale reach your nostrils. It's the familiar and comforting scent of civilization, of safety. 

Inside, despite the hardships the town of Bree is currently facing, the inn thrums with a warm buzz. The locals huddle at their tables, nursing their drinks, their faces etched with weariness, yet smiling, laughing. It seems in here, at least, they've found a way to forget their worries, if only for a little while.

As you step in, you barely get a moment to take in the lively scene. Before you can find a table or order a meal, a sudden ruckus breaks out. A heated argument between two boisterous patrons and a petite, flustered waitstaff member captures the room's attention. 

"I've told you, you have to pay up! We can't serve you any more until you've cleared your tab," the server, a young woman with braided hair, pleads, her voice barely audible over the indignant grumbling of the pair.

"But we ain't got no coin, lass!" slurs one of the men, a burly figure with unkempt hair and a crooked nose, his words slurring into one another. His companion, a wiry man with a scar trailing down his cheek, nods his head, attempting to look sincere and failing miserably.

The room watches on, a mix of sympathy for the waitstaff and annoyance at the inebriated pair palpable in the air. It seems like the peaceful evening at the "Plowed Farmer Inn" might turn sour if something isn't done soon.

# The Mill Encounter: Rats in the Grain
**Location:** [[The Town of Bree#The Desolate Grain Mill|The Desolate Grain Mill]]

## Introduction

As your party leaves the heart of Bree, they follow a well-trodden path toward the Weeping Widow River, guided by the sound of sluggish water trickling over worn rocks. Rounding a final bend, they lay eyes on their objective: the grain mill.

Approaching the entrance of the grain mill:
**Perception Check - DC 10**: 
**Success**: The first thing you notice is the sound of scratching and squeaking echoing from within the dark interior. The normal tranquility of the site is replaced by an unsettling movement in the shadows, a flurry of activity that hints at the infestation within.
**Fail**: A heavy gust of wind howls through the rafters causing the well-worn beams to creak slightly. The sour scent of, what you can only guess is spoiled grain, fill your nose. It's remarkably quiet in here.

## Encounter Details:
-   2 [Swarms of Rats](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17032-swarm-of-rats) (CR 1/4 each)
-   1 [Diseased Giant Rat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/288142-diseased-giant-rat), acting as the Rat King (CR 1/8)

## Encounter Dynamics:

The swarms will be the first to respond to the party's intrusion, rushing forward to defend their newfound territory. They move as a singular entity, seeking to surround and overwhelm the party members. This will introduce the players to the concept of fighting multiple enemies and managing positioning on the battlefield.

Hidden amongst the chaos, the Rat King (Giant Rat) lurks in the shadows. This rat is larger, smarter, and more aggressive than the others. It will attempt to ambush isolated party members or those who are already dealing with the swarms, teaching players about enemy tactics and the importance of sticking together.

Remember, the interior of the mill offers opportunities for environmental interaction. Players can overturn sacks of remaining grain to distract the swarms, climb onto machinery for safety, or possibly even manipulate the mill's mechanisms to their advantage.

## Aftermath:

Once the last squeak echoes through the mill, and the party stands victorious, they will have succeeded in their first quest for the town of Bree. The town's folk, although they can't offer much, are grateful and will do their best to help clean and restore the mill. The reputation of the adventurers will start to rise in Bree.

# Quest Proposal: Safe Passage
**Location:** [[The Town of Bree#The Spotted Sparrow General Store|The Spotted Sparrow General Store]]

In the light of the desperate situation in Bree, the worst of human nature has surfaced in the form of banditry. Few members of the town know who these robbers are, with some even suspecting desperate townsfolk, while others believe they are outsiders preying on the town's vulnerability.

The primary victim of these crimes is [[The Town of Bree#The Spotted Sparrow General Store|The Spotted Sparrow General Store]], the general store run by Faelan and Annalise. Despite the couple's determination and unwavering hope for better times, they have had to endure the theft of their limited supplies.

Faelan and Annalise's primary supplier, a merchant based in the port city to the southwest, has been understanding of the situation thus far. The merchant has allowed the couple to take goods on credit, understanding the difficulties faced by the small town. 

However, even the most patient merchants still demand coin, and the debts accrewed by [[Faelan and Annalise]] have come due.
