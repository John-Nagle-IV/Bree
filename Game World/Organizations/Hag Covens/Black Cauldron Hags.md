Having taken up residence within [[Port Viaz-Ros]], this trio of hags has taken a liking to the conflict between the two houses that permeates the twin city. Their aim is to foment chaos and animosity between the sides, gain power within the city, and ultimately expand their vial influence deeper into the [[Empire of the New Dawn]] toppling the other Hag covens.

## Selma Greenbone
*Type:* [Green Hag](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16911-green-hag)
### Appearance
In her human form, she appears as an elderly woman with a slightly elongated smile, hair tied up in a tight blond bun, and tanned skin from what appears to be far too long a time spent in the sun. Jovial and speaking with almost a giggle at all times, she exudes happiness. 

While in her Hag form, her skin cracks and bulbous pustules blister and pop as yellow and green puss oozes down her flesh. Her cloths are stained with a variety of fluids and her hair is a dull patchy gray.

Promising relief to sailors with brews, Selma stocks the bars with a maddening concoction causing extreme fits of laughter and violent outbursts. A few sips from her cups and the whole bar will be laughing like maniacs while bludgeoning each other to a giggling corps.
