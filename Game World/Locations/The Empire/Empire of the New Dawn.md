# The Story Told
Over one thousand years ago there were seven great kingdoms when the Mad Wizard King released a great spell across his own lands, killing his own subjects and raising them as ravenous undead minions. Two of the other kingdoms, either out of fear or personal gain, saw fit to ally themselves with the Mad King. They too gave up their bodies and souls along with their citizens, becoming powerful undead in their own right.

The remaining four kingdoms banded together becoming the "[[Empire of the New Dawn]]" lead by the first Empress, [[Lassev Beaux]]. The former kings and queens knelt to her and became her court and council.

No sooner were the alliances forged than the battle lines were drawn. Stories and texts describe endless waves of undead crashing into valorous warriors. Thousands fell in what became known as "[[The Long Night]]"; it was the first great battle of the "[[Endless War]]".

The undead would ravage the continent eventually consuming and controlling half of the known world only being stopped by the great craftsmen who built "[[The Bulwark]]"; a great wall that has held back the bulk of the horde.

While their work has been widely agreed to have been what keeps the boundless horrors at bay, it does not stop all threats. Cultists, monsters, and the odd outbreak of undead are still common throughout the Empire. Those who are willing to risk life and limb to defend the lands from these threats are the adventurers. They are united under the "[[Adventurer's Union]]".

# The Story Untold
The "Mad Wizard King", [[Tasim Vuforn]], in his research on the origins of magic discovered that the planet was an egg fostering the life of a [[Celestial Beasts]]. His discovery of the beast, along with how its lifecycle works caused him to raise alarm.

Spreading his discovery to the other kingdoms, there became two conflicting opinions on how to proceed. [[Tasim Vuforn]] along with [[Uzohr Denell]] and [[Olyn Esero]] agreed that to save their kingdoms and the rest of the planet, the population would need to be managed.

[[Lassev Beaux]], [[Gibin Ahion]], [[Shifarih Xoflyn]], and [[Strugast Wilore]] all saw their place as stewards of the beast with a duty to see it hatch and create more worlds across the cosmos.

This division made [[Tasim Vuforn]] take drastic action. He unleashed a spell that would convert his kingdom to undead and turn him into a [Lich](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16943-lich). [[Uzohr Denell]] and [[Olyn Esero]] followed his examples, and their three kingdoms became what is now known as the [[Blighted Lands]]. Their population became sentient undead; no longer able to have children, but also no longer contributing to the ever-looming threshold that would awaken the beast.

[[Lassev Beaux]] and her newly found court, seeing this action as a hostile act against what they deemed to be their purpose in life, struck out against the [[Blighted Lands]] sending the first armies into the territory. Rebuking her advances and retaliating, the undead too began their march into the [[Empire of the New Dawn]], and thus the construction of [[The Bulwark]] began.
