# First Impressions
As the players push open the heavy wooden door of Ingval's Forge and Fettle, they're immediately enveloped in the warm, inviting glow of the forge. The air is filled with the rich scents of hot metal and smoldering coals. The steady rhythm of a hammer striking an anvil provides a comforting backdrop to the scene.

The interior is a splendid showcase of craftsmanship. Armor of various styles and sizes, from gleaming chain mail to sturdy leather pieces, is displayed meticulously along the walls. 

In one corner stands a series of mannequins, each donning different sets of armor, as if frozen mid-pose in a silent dance of battle. Tables and shelves are strewn with various tools and materials, suggesting ongoing projects and the artisan's dedication to his craft.

At the forge, a stout, gray-bearded dwarf works intently, his expert hands shaping a piece of glowing metal. This is [[Ingval Ironbeard]], his face illuminated by the fire, focused yet approachable, embodying the spirit of a master craftsman at his labor of love.

The atmosphere is one of industry and artistry, a place where the practical needs of protection and warfare meet the beauty of skilled metalwork.
