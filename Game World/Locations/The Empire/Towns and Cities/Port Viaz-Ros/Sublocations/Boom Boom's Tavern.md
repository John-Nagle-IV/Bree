Run by a rough-and-tumble goblin known as [[Boom Boom]], the tavern is a brawling pit for those who prefer to order their drinks and have them be delivered straight to the head by a hearty throw.

# Description
The sign to the tavern has long been blown off its hinges and can be found firmly embedded in the opposing wall surrounded by scorch marks. Splintered boards and loose nails barely keep this place together.
