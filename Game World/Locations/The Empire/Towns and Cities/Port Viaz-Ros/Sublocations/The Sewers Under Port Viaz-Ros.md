The sewars are a maze of tunnels, pipes, and canals dug to handle the refuse of the city above. The [[City Core of Engineers]] filled these passageways with all manner of Oozes to consume the refuse people dispose of along.

In order to find ones way through, they need to know where to go and how to get there. There are two items needed:

1) [[Map of the Sewars]] 
2) A scry or clue to their target

Each of these will move their investigation roll from *Disadvantage* -> *Normal* -> *Advantage*
