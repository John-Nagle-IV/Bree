This inn is on the cheaper side and resides spitting distance from the docks. It provides simple beds, a footlocker, and nightstand for each single room. Atop the nightstand there sits a candle for those who may wander in past sundown.

There are 4 floors above the ground floor, each containing 6 rooms. Some are large enough to comfortably stay 2 people, but most contain only a single bed.

On the ground floor there is a small desk behind which protrudes a wall of hooks with all available keys dangling. **Isabella** can usually be found behind that desk being the first to greet any guests and deal with any issues that may arise in the rooms.

Behind the desk, to the right of the wall of keys, there is also a door leading to the office. In there another small table with a couple of chairs, stacks of papers noting the operations of the inn, and a heavy locked chest.

Facing the desk to the right is the stares zigzagging up to the top floor and connecting each hall of rooms along the way

Facing the desk to the right and stretching back is the small dining hall with the kitchen attached at the back. From the kitchen, a trapdoor to the cellar can be found keeping the beer and vegetables cool.
# Innkeeper

**Mrs. Isabella Keep** - Young human woman, only 20 years of age, Isabella keeps her blond hair in a tight bun. Having inherited the Inn from family before her, though not much in pomp and wares, she takes pride in the simple things and does her best with limited means to keep the inn clean and comfortable for her guests.

**Charity Smalls** - A middle-aged halfling woman dressed in a simple white frock and comfortable, clean linens. She handles much of the serving in the first floor dining area. She can always be seen darting from the tables to the kitchen and back as she fills orders.

**Grong Pebless** - An exceptionally harry dwarf with a long gray beard and massive, bulbous nose. He is the man in the kitchen, keeping the hearth hot, the stew warm, and the beers cold.
