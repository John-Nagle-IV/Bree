***Danger Sense.*** You gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.
 
 You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

***Fast Movement.*** Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.

***Feral Instinct.*** Your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

***Unarmored Defense.*** While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
## Actions

***Bow Breaker.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (1d12+6) slashing damage plus 3 slashing damage.

- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +4 bonus to the damage roll.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
- If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.
