Ingval is a stout, middle-aged dwarf with a beard like a cascade of iron-gray, often tucked into his belt to keep it out of the way. His eyes, a piercing blue, gleam with a mix of cunning and mirth beneath bushy eyebrows. His hands are the hands of a craftsman â€“ calloused and strong, accustomed to the heat of the forge and the weight of the hammer.

Despite this, he is a shrewd businessman, with a keen eye for quality and detail. He is well-respected for his expertise in armor and is often sought after by warriors and adventurers alike.
