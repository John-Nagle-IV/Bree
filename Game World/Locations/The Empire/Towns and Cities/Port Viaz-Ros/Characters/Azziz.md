# Description
Standing at 6'1", Azziz is a proud, black-scaled dragonborn merchant specializing in weapons. He is adorned in various gold rings and hoops looped through two back-growing horns. His garb is a simple tan linen [Kurta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurta) with a silver collar and cuffs.

Scrupulous in business, Azziz will gladly overcharge on wears if he can.

Though he is contracted with the [[Merchant Guild]], he does not always abide by all their rules having run afoul of them several times before in the trafficking of restricted goods.

Cleric of the "God of contracts"
