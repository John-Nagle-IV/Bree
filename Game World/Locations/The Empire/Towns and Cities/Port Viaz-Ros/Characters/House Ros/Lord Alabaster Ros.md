Lord Alabaster Ros is the noble lord who runs the other half of the Twin City of [[Port Viaz-Ros]]. He is very proud of his half of the city and has worked hard to live up to his family's name. He is 56 years old, with a bad comb-over, and a pronounced gap between his two front teeth. While he was slightly portly, anxiety has been keeping him awake and he has lost a bit of weight, not fitting his cloths too well.![[LordAlabasterRos.png]]
