The dark and winding tunnels give way to numerous caverns. The walls glow a blue-purple hue as crystals emanate cool light, and the air smells of wet stone. Creatures that have adapted to this land are plentiful, and there is such diversity that this underground could be a whole world to explore on its own. The denizens have carved massive towns and cities into the cavern walls.

Tunnels lead somewhere, and that is the [[Underdark]].
