The Cauldron is a giant crater that has become the testing grounds for [[Beacon]]. Wizards of the City-College test their magics, potions, and experiments with reckless abandon causing all sorts of oddities and mutations. The air crackles of volatile magic, and creatures have been mutated into abominations and chimeras. It is a harsh land full of intrigue and mystery. Even the students of [[Beacon]] don't know what their experiments have wrought.

# Locations
## The Cauldron
There are multiple effects that are ongoing in the area.

### Wild Magic Abound
From years of young wizards using this area as a testing ground, the air is charged with lingering magics.

*When any leveled spell is cast, the casting player rolls an unmodified d20. The DC for the roll is equal to 10 + the spell level. On a failure, a random effect from the [[WildMagicTable.jpg|Wild Magic Table]] happens.*

### Evolutionary Slime
The water has become thick and viscous, but worst of all mutagenic. Potions, spell-work, and other traces of students' work has changed the one clear water into something dangerous. When a character touches the water they must roll on the [[#Mutation Table]] to determine the effect.

#### Mutations
*Claws and Fangs* - The target's nails and teeth elongate taking on a beast-like form for 10 minutes. They can be used to make attacks and the wielder is proficient in them.
* __Bite.__ STR + PROFICIENCY to hit, reach 5 ft. one target. *Hit* 1d6 + STR slashing damage.
* __Claw.__ STR + PROFICIENCY + 1 to hit, reach 5 ft. one target. *Hit* 1d4 + STR slashing damage.

*Gills* - The target sprouts gills for 10 minutes becoming able to breath water, but unable to breath air.

*Tail* - The target grows a tail that can be used in combat to make attacks. They are proficient in its use.
* **Tail Slam.** STR + PROFICIENCY to hit, reach 5 ft. one target. *Hit* 1d8 + STR bludgeoning damage.

*Cat's Eyes* - The target's pupil elongates into a cat-like form. They gain [Darkvision](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters?expansion=0#toc_20) out to 60 feet  for 1 hour. If the target already has [Darkvision](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters?expansion=0#toc_20) the range is extended by an additional 60 feet.

*Acid Sack* - The target gains a new organ temporarily. For the next 1 hour or until used, they may expel the acid in a *15 ft cone*. Anything caught in this cone needs to make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals *8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus*. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.

*Shrink* - The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category--from Medium to Small, for example. Until the effect ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1). This lasts for 10 minutes.

*Enlarge* - The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category-- from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage. This lasts for 10 minutes.

*Poisoned* - Toxicity runs through the veins of the target as their blood partially mutates to poison. The target suffers from the [poisoned condition](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions#toc_10) for 1 hour. Every 10 minutes they make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 1d12 poison damage. On success, they take half. This condition can be removed by use of the [Protection from Poison](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:Protection%20from%20Poison#content) spell or [Lesser Restoration](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:Lesser%20Restoration#content) spell.

*Diseased* - The microcosm that dwells in us all evolves and mutates separately from the rest of the target's body. The target suffers from a disease for 1 hour. Every 10 minutes they make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they suffer 1 level of exhaustion. This condition can be removed by use of the [Lesser Restoration](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:Lesser%20Restoration#content) spell.

*Confusion* - The target's mind is flooded with a haze of confusion for 1 hour. They suffer disadvantage on all skill checks. This condition can be removed by use of the [Lesser Restoration](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:Lesser%20Restoration#content) spell or [Mind Blank](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:Mind%20Blank#content) spell.

*Voice of the Wild* - The target looses all sense of language but gains the ability to [Speak with Animals](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Speak%20with%20Animals#h-Speak%20with%20Animals) for 10 minutes.
