Cressonport is a bustling port town to the southeast of [[The Town of Bree]], a three-day journey through dense woods and along winding rivers. The town has managed to remain prosperous through the drought, primarily due to its strategic location as a trading hub and the diversity of its goods and resources.

The town's most notable figure is Baroness Knightsgall, a savvy businesswoman who runs a sizable merchant operation from Cressonport. Known for her sharp mind and sharper tongue, she deals in a variety of goods and has developed an extensive network of traders, suppliers, and customers throughout the region.

[[Baroness Knightsgall]] is a shrewd negotiator and is not known for her leniency when it comes to debt. Yet she also possesses a keen understanding of the broader picture and the intricacies of commerce. While she requires the payment from [[Faelan and Annalise]], she also understands the need for stability in the region, especially in towns like Bree that supply grain and other produce.

Despite her tough exterior, she's known to help out struggling communities from time to time, albeit with the expectation of future repayments or favors. The party's successful delivery of the payment could open up a dialog with [[Baroness Knightsgall]], potentially leading to future quests, alliances, or business opportunities.

The journey from Bree to Cressonport will provide opportunities for the party to encounter various creatures, bandits, and perhaps even some environmental challenges, such as crossing a fast-flowing river or navigating through a dense and confusing forest.
