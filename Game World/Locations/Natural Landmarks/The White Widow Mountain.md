# The Legend
The folklore tells of two giant beings, lovers in the primordial era when the land was new. These towering entities dominated the eastern horizon and were rulers of the land. In a cataclysmic battle among giants, one of the lovers was tragically slain.

## History of the Mountain
These lovers represent the two original peaks of the mountain range. Several thousand years ago, the larger peak erupted violently, shaking the earth and darkening the skies. This eruption was so intense that it blew off half of the second peak and effectivly merged both into one mountain - the one now known as the White Widow Mountain.

The enormous amount of ash and volcanic soil ejected during the eruption enriched the surrounding lands, creating a fertile paradise ideal for agriculture. For generations, Bree has reaped the benefits of this nutrient-rich soil, becoming a significant contributor to the local grain production.
