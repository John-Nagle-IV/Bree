# Custom Exhaustion Table

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 1 | Move speed reduced by half |
| 2 | Disadvantage on Skill Checks |
| 3 | Disadvantage on Attacks Rolls and Saving Throws |
| 4 | Critical Hits do not double damage dice, and player's cannot cast spells requiring concentration |
| 5 | Player can pick only 1 during combat: Action, Move, Bonus Action |

# Potions
Potions may be consumed as a bonus action. Doing so will have the player roll for the effectiveness of the potion.

Consuming the potion as a full action allows for the full effect of the potion without a roll.

# Sleep
Sleeping well on the road is important and as such you need supplies. A bedroll allows for comfortable sleep. Without one, one needs to make a DC 10 Constitution Saving Throw or else they do not benefit from the long rest and only recover half their available hit dice.
