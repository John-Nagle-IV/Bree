# Potions
Potions may be consumed as a bonus action. Doing so will have the player roll for the effectiveness of the potion.

Consuming the potion as a full action allows for the full effect of the potion without a roll.

# Sleep
Sleeping well on the road is important and as such you need supplies. A bedroll allows for comfortable sleep. Without one, one needs to make a DC 10 Constitution Saving Throw or else they do not benefit from the long rest and only recover half their available hit dice.

# Spell Scrolls
- **Identifying a spell on a scroll**
	- If you are able to cast the spell, there is no role, you can immediately identify the spell
	- If your class is able to cast the spell, an intelligence check DC 10 + spell level is required
	- If  you have caster levels but the spell is not within your class's spell list, you may still identify the spell with an intelligence check of DC 12 + spell level
- **Casting a spell on the scroll**
	- If the spell is able to be cast without the scroll, then it can be cast with the scroll and no components are needed, nor spell slot
	- If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.
		- If you are a caster, but the spell isn't on your list, the DC is 14 + spell level.
