Dwarfs and Elves are both very proud of their artists and craftsmanship and have an ongoing "Art Feud" trying to make the most detailed and intricate piece of art and constantly critiquing the other's

Currently elves are trying to grow a tree made out of rocks in the mountains, and dwarfs are trying to make a mountain out of a forest.

Both these projects are sponsored by the [[Dwarven Craftsman Union]] and [[Elvin Art Collective]]. Both these organizations have a fund to support the endeavors. It's the same fund that is sponsoring both works. The fund is named the "Fuck You" fund. Both sides draw from it to pay for the craftsmanship and artists.

It was deemed a communal fund to prevent merchants from influencing the art war. The winner will be from skill alone and will be crowned once both guilds acknowledge a single work. This has never once been done since the 2,000 year founding of the institutions and fund.

Both sides are proud to admit that they have no problem conceding and praising the work of their rivals if they manage to produce something actually worth the praise.
